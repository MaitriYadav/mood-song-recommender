ðŸŽµ Mood-Based Song Recommender

This project is an intelligent music recommendation system that suggests songs based on the userâ€™s energy level â€” no need to describe your mood in detail. Whether youâ€™re feeling pumped, relaxed, or low-energy, the model maps your input to a mood and suggests music that matches how you feel.

  Features
	â€¢	 ML-powered recommendation based on energy input
	â€¢	 Mood detection mapped to music types (e.g., happy, sad, party)
	â€¢	 Simple user interface: just input your energy level
	â€¢	 Returns curated songs for that emotional state

  How It Works
	1.	User enters their current energy level
	2.	A trained ML model predicts the likely mood
	3.	System recommends songs from a curated mood-based database

  Tech Stack
	â€¢	Python
	â€¢	Machine Learning (scikit-learn / custom model)
	â€¢	Flask / HTML for front-end (if included)
	â€¢	Git & GitHub for version control
